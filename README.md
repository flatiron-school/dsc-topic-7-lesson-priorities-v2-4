# 1st Priority

If you are short on time, be sure to make it through these items:

- SQL Table Relations - Introduction
- Join Statements
- SQL Subqueries 
- SQL - Cumulative Lab
> Note: If you can't yet see the cumulative lab, don't worry. It may not be visible until a pair programming session led by your instructor.

# 2nd Priority

- Join Statements  
- One-to-Many and Many-to-Many Joins
- One-to-Many and Many-to-Many Joins - Lab
- SQL Subqueries - Lab

# Appendix

After learning about the fundamentals of SQL statements and table relationships, move to the Appendix.  The Appendix will introduce you to **pandasql** library, which is another tool you may use to query DataFrames with SQL syntax. 

You will also have the opportunity to practice realworld SQL interview questions.  If you don't have time to attempt the interview questions, make sure to come back to them as you get closer to the job search.  



# Note On Lesson Priorities

The items in the topics are meant to be completed sequentially. Lesson priorities are meant to help you zero in on the most important content if you are short on time. That does not mean the items marked as 2nd Priority are not important to your development as a data scientist. Rather, it means that they do not introduce concepts that are essential to progressing through the Flatiron Data Science program.

You will notice that many labs are marked 2nd Priority. Labs reinforce concepts which are introduced by prior items. If you are short on time, your first priority should be to digest the concept where it has been introduced, then reinforce the concept in the lab when you have time.
